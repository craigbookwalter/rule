### No added sugars
Instead of turning to sweetened beverages and treats for comfort, turn to our Lord who longs to comfort you.

### Limit fruit
One serving of fruit per day lest fruit replace the comfort of sugar.

### No hot beverages
Give your hot tea and coffee to our suffering Lord, who on the cross must surely have felt cold from all the blood he lost.

### No alcohol
No alcohol during the Lenten retreat.

### No snacking
Eat a maximum of 3 meals daily (less on fasting days) and nothing in between. Remain in the desert with the Lord, do not reach for comfort foods in between meals.
